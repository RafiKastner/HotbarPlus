# About
HotbarPlus is an open-source module made to make hotbars easier.

You can create sufficient hotbars in **less than 10 lines!** ðŸ¥³

HotbarPlus fully supports PC and mobile, allowing items to be selected with mouse click, a key, tapping, or an external activator.

## Construction ðŸ§±
Use a standard `.new()` constructor
```lua
local Hotbar = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Hotbar)
local item = Hotbar.new()
```

## Methods
```lua
item:setText("Cool text")
item:setLabel("1")
```
Do stuff like
- binding functions to events
- binding conditions for those functions 
- changing the appearance
- changing behavior
- and more!

> **Note:** Pertaining to appearances, themes will be added soon. Currently you can only change the widget that they are cloned fromâ€”i.e. all items mantain the same appearence and cannot be changed after creation.

### Method Chaining ðŸ”—
All methods return `self` which means you can chain methods like so
```lua
local item = Hotbar.new()
    :bindEvent("selected", function(icon)
        print("I was selected")
    end)
    :bindToggleKey("Two")
```
or like so ðŸ˜±
```lua
item:bindCondition("wasUsed", "used", function(icon)
    return false
end)
    :setName("Sword")
```
